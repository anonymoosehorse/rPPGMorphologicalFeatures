Currently two datasets are used for testing. 
- VIPL-HR: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04927.pdf
- In-House-dataset: available on request

## Data preprocessing

Use the [preprocessing_in_one.py](/src/preprocessing_in_one.py) script to preprocess the datasets for training.

## Training a network

Use the [lightning_main.py](/src/lightning_main.py) script to preprocess the datasets for training.
